The Vim configuration is used in my daily work. I mainly use Neovim but still
keep compatibility for Vim in terms of portability. Because I'm not only a
serious developer who code on Apple machines, but also a system administrator
who operates on various unix-like machines. There are many languages I work
with, including, but not limited to, PHP, Java, C, Python, JavaScript. Hope it
might be useful if you speak the same language too. This Vim configuration
isn't meant to make Vim looks like an IDE. It's optimized for security,
efficiency and vim-ish with ♥️.

## Installation

> Don't blindly use someones's configuration

I don't recommend it. Vim is not supposed to be used by that way. Instead, Just
borrow some lines you might be interested in. or if you would like to see how
good is my taste.

    (cd $HOME; git clone https://github.com/Gasol/vimrc .vim)

Only needed when it failed to install some plugins automatically.

    nvim +'call dein#install()' 

## Features

TODO

* Fast startup

  Compares startup time to the minimum config (-u NONE) of Neovim

  ```diff
  -019.621  000.002: --- NVIM STARTED ---
  +394.388  000.002: --- NVIM STARTED ---
  ```

## Leader Key

The `<Space>` bar have chosen to be leader key instead of `,` by default.
Because we don't need additional keystroke for actions like `l` key which only
move the cursor to the next character.
